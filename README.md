The whole project has 4 sub projects:

Chat bot for HiPrice. Also contains admin console for bot login. Requires MySQL/MariaDB and Beanstalk.
- [hiprice-dispatcher](https://github.com/kwf2030/hiprice-dispatcher)
Dispatcher for HiPrice. Collects product links and dispatches to runners. Requires MySQL/MariaDB and Beanstalk.
- [hiprice-runner](https://github.com/kwf2030/hiprice-runner)
Crawler for HiPrice. Deploy as many runners as you can, they are "distributed". Requires Beanstalk and Chrome/Chromium.
- [hiprice-web](https://github.com/kwf2030/hiprice-web)
Web for HiPrice. Manage your own watched products.

You may need the [docker-compose](docker-compose.yaml) that lauches all services in one step, the docker-compose does not contain hiprice-runner, compiles and runs it manually.

While all services get up, go to http://localhost:6200/admin to get your wechat bot login, and then congratulations, your bot is working! Send it "help" to see how to play.

__Note: wechat bot uses remark as persistent scheme, it will remarks all your friends with sequence number while you login, that means all your remarks before will be lost and can not restore, use it in caution(you can apply a new wechat account for testing purpose).__
